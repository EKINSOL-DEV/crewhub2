# Cost policy

## Default: zero model calls for presentation

World rendering, character animation, pathfinding, camera movement, attention
signals, session discovery, status mapping, and ordinary tool labels must use
deterministic application logic. Demo mode requires no account, key, network
service, or running harness.

Opening the app, entering a room, selecting a character, reconnecting a source,
or leaving a tab open must never start an agent or request inference.

Implemented: the world makes zero model calls. crewhub-loops is its only source
of facts, and in demo mode the scripted in-browser source stands in for it. The
scripted director (deterministic code, no model) stands in for the optional
director and plays its intents only inside an entered building. `npm test` fails
on an AI SDK import or a model endpoint.

Existing sessions still incur their normal provider usage when they perform work
in crewhub-loops. The world does not make that work free and must not duplicate
it. It never holds provider credentials and never claims an unavailable
subscription entitlement.

## Optional AI features, later

Planned, not built: an optional director on Haiku or another very cheap model
(see [LOOPS_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md](LOOPS_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md) section 7.3). It is
off by default and capped by a request and token budget, with a kill switch.

Summaries and conversational flavor are optional and disabled until configured.
Any such feature must define its trigger, model choice, cache key, maximum input,
output and call limits, cancellation behavior, and visible usage reporting.

- Prefer an explicit user request. Do not infer permission for recurring calls
  from permission to connect a session.
- Cache summaries against relevant content revisions and reuse them across views.
- Coalesce bursts of updates. Never call a model per event, character, or frame.
- Bound context and retries; do not silently escalate to a more expensive model.
- Provide feature and global off switches, and a hard request/token budget.
- Use currency estimates only when actual pricing and usage information are
  available. Otherwise say the cost is unknown.
- Keep metrics local by default. No external telemetry in the bootstrap.

## Graphics also have a budget

Reuse geometry and materials, cap rendering resolution, avoid needless state
updates, suspend hidden-tab work, and offer reduced motion and lower quality.
Local graphics can consume battery even when inference costs are zero.

## Acceptance

The world, in demo mode and when it later reads crewhub-loops through the host,
must operate with all model access disabled. Document any new network endpoint, background loop, model trigger, and
its cancellation path when adding functionality. A visual feature is not an
exception to this policy.
